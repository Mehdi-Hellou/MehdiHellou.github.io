<h2> Hi, My name is Mehdi Hellou</h2>
<p> I am an Early-Stage Researcher and a PhD student at the University of Manchester in the EU, working on the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks project <a href="https://www.perseo.eu/" target="_blank">PERSEO</a>.
    My research focuses on improving social robot behaviors in complex environments by applying the premises of the Theory of Mind (ToM) for personalised interactions. This is done under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/angelo.cangelosi" target="_blank">Prof. Angelo Cangelosi</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/samuele-vinanzi/" target="_blank">Dr. Samuele Vinanzi</a>. 
    The research includes designing and testing of a computational architecture for ToM, which considers each user's differences and needs to support the personalisation of the robot's interaction with the user.<br>
    <br>
    My passion for robotics led me to complete a Master of Engineering in Robotics from Polytech Sorbonne University. 
    I also completed a second Masters in Computer Science at Sorbonne University Pierre and Marie Curie.
