During my master's in ANDROIDE at Sorbonne University, one of my courses focused primarily on virtual and interactive environments. The most important part of the study was to build a project implying the development of a virtual environment using Unity 3D, which was able to interact and adapt to the user.

In doing so, we decided with my colleague to develop an" escape-run game" where the player could control a character in a 3D environment using either a keyboard or a Kinect camera. The purpose was to allow the game to adapt its environment and difficulty to the player's level. This project allowed me to develop abilities and skills in the area of human-machine interaction and self-learning.
You can see a short demo of the project just below.
