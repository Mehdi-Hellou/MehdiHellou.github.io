During my internship of 2 months in the company Robottuner in Wageningen, I had to simulate and control the robot Pepper's motion with Unity 3D.

The purpose was to simulate the robot pepper into a virtual environment and use it to set the robot's motion in real-time using the Nav Mesh Agent technology in Unity 3D.
Just beneath, you can see a quick demo of my work.
